The database includes proceedings of international conferences, symposia, seminars, colloquia, workshops, and conventions. Click this link to access Web of Science. In the search box, type in your keyword search terms. For instance, if your topic is Separation of dairy cow from calf, you can use keyword search terms cow AND calf AND separation. You can sort the results using the following options: Citations Citations displays the total number of times a published work was cited by other works. Usage The Usage is a measure of the level of interest in a specific item on the Web of Science platform. The count reflects the number of times the article has met a user’s information needs. Relevance Relevance sorts records in descending order based on a ranking system that considers how many of the search terms are found in each record. Relevance ordering for source records takes into account the following fields-Title, Abstract, Keywords, and Keywords Plus. Click the number next to Times Cited to view all the other articles that cited this particular article. Click Full Text from Publisher to retrieve the full-text article from the publisher’s site, or Find It to retrieve the article from U of I Library’s catalog. Citation Chaining Citation chaining is a research technique in which you use one source to find related documents. There are two types of citation chaining: Forward Chaining - Starting with one work and looking at the works that have cited the current work as a reference. Backward Chaining - Looking at what documents the current work cites and then following those backward by looking at the documents they cite. In a Web of Science record, you can click Citations for forward chaining and References for backward chaining."

        "text": "Databases In addition to Academic Search Premier and Web of Science, here are a few more useful databases to find scholarly articles on dairy science: Agricola (Ebsco) Over 4.8 million citations to journal articles, monographs, theses, patents, software, audio-visual materials, and technical reports. Covers agriculture, plant and animal sciences, forestry, entomology, soil and water resources, and food and nutrition. CAB Direct Subjects covered include animal science; crop protection; plant science; parasitology; human and animal nutrition; natural resources and ecology; forestry, forest products and agroforesty; soil science; rural development, tourism and economics; food science and food products; biotechnology; and agricultural engineering. Some full-text content is available on the CABDirect platform. Sample search: Consumption AND “pasteurized* milk” AND “raw milk” AGRIS AGRIS is an international cooperative system that provides citations to journal literature, theses, reports and other publications in the agricultural sciences. CARIS is an international cooperative system that provides citations to current research in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, nutrition, rural development, agricultural economics, and topics in environmental and natural resource areas as they apply to agriculture. Journals The library subscribes to the following diary science journals, most of which are online. The articles published by these reputable journals are generally authoritative. Animal Feed Science and Technology Animal Genetics Applied Animal Behaviour Science Journals The library subscribes to the following diary science journals, most of which are online. The articles published by these reputable journals are generally authoritative. Animal Feed Science and Technology Animal Genetics Applied Animal Behaviour Science Dairy Foods Dairy Herd Management Dairy Industries International Dairy Science &amp; Technology Hoard’s Dairyman (print, microform) International Dairy Journal Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics Journal of Animal Science Journal of Dairy Science Journal of Food Science Professional Animal Scientist Print Books One viable search strategy to find print books on a topic is stack browsing. That is to visit the library and locate the physical bookshelves to browse the book collections with a particular subject focus area using LC call number. For example, if you are interested in Dairy processing and Dairy products, you would want to look for call numbers that start with SF250.5-275. Other relevant call numbers include: SF1-1100 Animal culture SF94.5-99 Feeds and feeding. Animal nutrition SF191-275 Cattle SF221-250 Dairying QP1-(981) Physiology QP501-801 Animal biochemistry Use the floor maps to locate the shelves that contain the specified call number groups. Government Documents When searching the library catalog, you can filter the results by Government Documents under Resource Type. These documents are located on the library basement. You can click this link or email Rami Attebury to learn more about how to access government documents. You can use Google to search for government documents as well. Add site:gov at the end of your keyword search terms will yield results from government webpages. For instance, if your topic is on Contribution of dairy industry to greenhouse gases, you can search for dairy AND “greenhouse gas” site:gov. Data and Statistics If you are looking for contextual background information and overview of issue at stake for your presentation, consider incorporating some data and statistics on production, consumption, price, or standards of dairy products: USDA dairy market news Milk marketing order statistics USDA economic research service dairy data USDA dairy products grades and standards US dairy export council dairy data dashboard USDA dairy products monthly production data USDA census of agriculture USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Citation Remember to cite your sources and format them according to the reference style of either Journal of Animal Science or Journal of Dairy Science. You may also consider using a citation manager (if you have never used one before) to cite your sources. A citation manager can be a time saver, and is incredibly useful if you are thinking about pursuing a master’s or doctoral degree in which considerable writing is expected. Check out the recording of library workshop on Citation Management with Zotero below if interested. Citation Management with Zotero"

        "text": "The assignment requires gathering information on consumers’ perceptions of your chosen subject. We will primarily use Academic Search Premier and CQ Researcher to find popular sources. Academic Search Premier Academic Search Premier is a multi-disciplinary database that contains full-text versions of thousands of publications, including academic titles, popular magazines, and newspapers. Since it covers nearly all fields of study, it’s a good place to start a research project. Keywords Search You can access Academic Search Premier from the library’s homepage under the catalog search bar. Once you log in with your UI credentials, you can type your keyword search terms in the search box. For example, if your topic is Use of bST (growth hormone) to increase milk production, you can type bST in the search box and click the Search button. This search yields over 4,000 results. You may notice that most results are irrelevant to our topic. Some results that came up when searching bST include Band Segmented Transmission, Behavior skills training, Barium Strontium Titanate, etc. Let’s revise our search strategy. This time, spell out the abbreviation bST, which stands for “Bovine somatotropin”. Since you are searching for the exact phrase, use quotation marks to wrap around the keywords after typing Bovine somatotropin in the search box, click the Search button. This search yields over 1,000 relevant results, including popular and scholarly sources. If you are only interested in popular sources for now, check the boxes for News and Magazines under Source Types on the left side of the screen. You may also change the Publication Date to limit the results to recent sources from the last few years. On the search results page, you can click the titles of the articles to access the abstracts and contents. The publishers and publication dates can be useful. For instance, since you are looking for sources that cover consumer’s perception of using bST to increase milk production, an article published by Consumers’ Research Magazine or FDA Consumer would provide such a perspective. If you are interested in reading about the topic with recent research, looking at articles published in the last few years would be appropriate; or, you can look at articles published in a span of ten or 20 years if you are interested in research from a more holistic perspective of the topic and how the public opinion or knowledge on the issue has changed over time. Feel free to conduct a CRAAP test (currency, relevance, authority, accuracy and purpose) to evaluate the sources based on various criteria. Subjects Search Subjects is another incredibly useful field that allows you to find results with better precision. Think of subjects as tags—information professionals categorize each information source based on what it is about—that an article may be related to the topic that you are interested in, but the keywords you used do not appear in the title or the content. For example, this article is about bovine somatotropin, but the language only included bovine growth hormone so a keyword search may not display this source. This is why searching with subject terms can be more reliable than with keywords. Other relevant subjects include: DRUG side effects MILK yield ANIMAL health FOOD safety DAIRY industry HEALTH MILK consumption Experiment with different combinations of subjects and keywords to see which ones work best for you needs. Full Text and Tools Other useful features of Academic Search Premier include HTML Full Text and PDF Full Text on the search results page and print, email, and export tools in the Tools panel on the search record page.
