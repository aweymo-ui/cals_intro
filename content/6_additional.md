## Databases

<br>

In addition to [Academic Search Premier](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.asp?profile=ehost&defaultdb=aph&defaultdb=f5h&defaultdb=ufh){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Web of Science](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://webofknowledge.com/UA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, here are a few more useful databases to find scholarly articles on dairy science:
- [Agricola (Ebsco)](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.asp?profile=ehost&defaultdb=agr){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  - Over 4.8 million citations to journal articles, monographs and theses
- [CAB Direct](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.cabdirect.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  - Subjects covered include animal science, crop protection and plant science
- [AGRIS](http://agris.fao.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  - AGRIS is an international cooperative system that provides citations to journal literature, theses and reports 

As well as **238 more databases** searchable on the library's [A-Z Databases resource](https://libguides.uidaho.edu/az/databases).

<br>

## Journals 

<br>

The library subscribes to the following diary science journals, most of which are online, including:

- [Animal Feed Science and Technology](https://www-sciencedirect-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/journal/animal-feed-science-and-technology){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Animal Genetics](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/journal/13652052){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Applied Animal Behaviour Science](https://www-sciencedirect-com.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/journal/applied-animal-behaviour-science){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

As well as **300,000 more peer reviewed journals** searchable on the library's [journal directory](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/journals.html).

<br>

## Print Books

<br>

One viable search strategy to find print books on a topic is stack browsing. That is to visit the library and locate the physical bookshelves to browse the book collections with a particular subject focus area using LC call number. For example, if you are interested in Dairy processing and Dairy products, you would want to look for call numbers that start with SF250.5-275. Other relevant call numbers include: 
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
         table {width: 100%;}
         table, td, th {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            padding: 8px;
            border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
         
         th {            
            style="text-align:Center"
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding-top: 12px;
            padding-bottom: 12px;
            background-color: #f1b300;
            color: white;
            }
      </style>
   </head>
   <body>
      <table>
         <tr>
            <td style="text-align:Left">SF1-1100</td>
            <td style="text-align:Left">Animal culture</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td style="text-align:Left">SF94.5-99</td>
            <td style="text-align:Left">Feeds and feeding. Animal nutrition</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td style="text-align:Left">SF191-275</td>

            <td style="text-align:Left">Animal biochemistry</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </body>
   <p>
   </p>
</html>
{% capture text %}Use the [floor maps](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/maps.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to locate the shelves that contain the specified call number groups.

## Government Documents

<br>

When searching the library catalog, you can filter the results by `Government Documents` under `Resource Type`. These documents are located on the library basement. You can click [this link](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/govdocs/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or email <a href = "mailto: rattebur@uidaho.edu">Rami Attebury</a> to learn more about how to access government documents. 

You can use Google to search for government documents as well. Add `site:gov` at the end of your keyword search terms will yield results from government webpages. For instance, if your topic is on **Mediterranean Diet and Cognition**, you can search for [site:.gov "Mediterranean" "Diet" AND "Cognition"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A.gov+%22Mediterranean%22+%22Diet%22+AND+%22Cognition%22&rlz=1C5GCCM_en&oq=site%3A.gov+%22Mediterranean%22+%22Diet%22+AND+%22Cognition%22&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEJMjk3MzZqMGo3qAIIsAIB8QVgXTlyu2C9ufEFYF05crtgvbk&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

## Data and Statistics

## Citation

<br>

Finally, I would recommend using a using a citation manager once you do find the materials you need. It is an incredibly helpful way to organize all of your research material, create and store annotations, generate bibliographies and then export this material for future preservation. Watch the following library workshop on Citation Management with Zotero below, or [visit my open educational resource on the platform](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/zotero_intro/) that will walk you through every step of the process you need.
