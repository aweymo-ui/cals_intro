**The assignment requires gathering information on consumers’ perceptions of your chosen subject**. We will primarily use Academic Search Premier and CQ Researcher to find popular sources. 

## Academic Search Premier

Academic Search Premier is a multi-disciplinary database that contains full-text versions of thousands of publications, including academic titles, popular magazines, and newspapers. Since it covers nearly all fields of study, it's a good place to start a research project.

#### Keywords Search

You can access Academic Search Premier from the [library’s homepage](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under the catalog search bar. Once you log in with your UI credentials, you can type your keyword search terms in the search box. For example, if your topic is **Use of bST (growth hormone) to increase milk production**, you can type *bST* in the search box and click the `Search` button. 

This search yields over 4,000 results. You may notice that most results are irrelevant to our topic. Some results that came up when searching bST include Band Segmented Transmission, Behavior skills training, Barium Strontium Titanate, etc. Let’s revise our search strategy. 

This time, spell out the abbreviation bST, which stands for *"Bovine somatotropin"*. Since you are searching for the exact phrase, use quotation marks to wrap around the keywords after typing *Bovine somatotropin* in the search box, click the `Search` button.

This search yields over 1,000 relevant results, including popular and scholarly sources. If you are only interested in popular sources for now, check the boxes for News and Magazines under Source Types on the left side of the screen. You may also change the Publication Date to limit the results to recent sources from the last few years. 

On the search results page, you can click the titles of the articles to access the abstracts and contents. The publishers and publication dates can be useful. For instance, since you are looking for sources that cover consumer’s perception of using bST to increase milk production, an article published by _Consumers' Research Magazine_ or _FDA Consumer_ would provide such a perspective. If you are interested in reading about the topic with recent research, looking at articles published in the last few years would be appropriate; or, you can look at articles published in a span of ten or 20 years if you are interested in research from a more holistic perspective of the topic and how the public opinion or knowledge on the issue has changed over time.

#### Subjects Search

Subjects is another incredibly useful field that allows you to find results with better precision. Think of subjects as tags—information professionals categorize each information source based on what it is about—that an article may be related to the topic that you are interested in, but the keywords you used do not appear in the title or the content. For example, [this article](https://uidaho.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f5h&AN=9610111153&site=ehost-live&scope=site){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is about *bovine somatotropin*, but the language only included *bovine growth hormone* so a keyword search may not display this source.

This is why searching with subject terms can be more reliable than with keywords.
Other relevant subjects include:
-	DRUG side effects
-	MILK yield
-	ANIMAL health
-	FOOD safety 
-	DAIRY industry 
-	HEALTH 
-	MILK consumption

Experiment with different combinations of subjects and keywords to see which ones work best for you needs.

#### Full Text and Tools

Other useful features of Academic Search Premier include `HTML Full Text` and `PDF Full Text` on the search results page and `print`, `email`, and `export` tools in the Tools panel on the search record page.
