**Diving into the electronic databases we have available at the library**, our [the U of I library catalog](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} main catalog is an excellent place to begin your search! In the search box, simply type in your keyword search terms to begin.

For instance, if your topic is **Low-fat vs. whole milk consumption**, you can use *"Low-fat" AND "whole milk" AND consumption* as your keyword search terms. The quotations and capitalized AND in this search are examples of what are called `boolean operators`, a "logical combinatorial system that represents symbolic relationships between entities" per Merriam-Webster. More simply, it's a way to refine what you are and are not looking for in a single search. 

 The most basic elements are using [AND](https://dp.la/search?q=Moscow+AND+Idaho&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [OR](https://dp.la/search?q=Moscow+OR+Idaho&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [NOT](https://dp.la/search?q=Moscow+NOT+Idaho&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} between keywords or putting [quotes](https://dp.la/search?q=%22Moscow%2C+Idaho%22&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} around your phrases to use an exact phrase and [parenthesis](https://dp.la/search?q=%28Moscow%2C+Idaho%29+AND+%28flour%29&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} when using multiple operators in the same line. Helpful Google (and Google Scholar) operators include [site:](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lib.uidaho.edu+%22video%22&sca_esv=f7f0ca8bbe6f40fd&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&sxsrf=ACQVn083DunaahW_XbbIVrxR8Z0y9uTihQ%3A1710957328889&ei=ECP7ZcTsNb6y0PEP4LuryAQ&oq=site%3A&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiBXNpdGU6KgIIADIEECMYJzIEEAAYAzITEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQYCjIEEAAYAzIQEAAYgAQYFBiHAhixAxiDATIEEAAYAzIEEAAYAzIQEC4YgAQYigUYQxjHARivATILEC4YgAQYxwEYrwEyBRAAGIAESORQUPMMWPw3cAJ4AZABAJgBaqABkQSqAQM1LjK4AQHIAQD4AQGYAgagAt0CwgIKEAAYRxjWBBiwA8ICBxAjGLACGCfCAgoQIRgKGKABGMMEmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcDNS4xoAeKHQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (as well as -site) to include or exclude results from specific sites and [AROUND(#)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Moscow%2C+Idaho+AND+flour+AROUND+%284%29&sca_esv=f7f0ca8bbe6f40fd&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&sxsrf=ACQVn0-pXlPjzFPEGk9pSd4FMUGD3j1v-g%3A1710957636133&ei=RCT7ZbPiB8GK0PEPz8aF6Ao&ved=0ahUKEwizlILxtYOFAxVBBTQIHU9jAa0Q4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=Moscow%2C+Idaho+AND+flour+AROUND+%284%29&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiIk1vc2NvdywgSWRhaG8gQU5EIGZsb3VyIEFST1VORCAoNCkyCBAhGKABGMMEMggQIRigARjDBDIIECEYoAEYwwRIkg1Q8gZYkQdwAXgBkAEAmAF_oAHvAaoBAzAuMrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAqACecICChAAGEcY1gQYsAOYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwMxLjGgB7sG&sclient=gws-wiz-serp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to produce results where your two keywords on either side are within a certain number of words with each other.

### Summit vs. only UIdaho collections

<br>

{% include gallery-figure.html img="Screenshots-07.png" alt="Summit" width="100%" %}

In the dropdown menu next to the magnifying glass icon in the search box, choose UI Library+E-Resources if you are **only interested in resources that can be found in the U of I Library and online**. Otherwise, choose UI+Summit+E-Resources to access resources in [37 academic libraries throughout Oregon, Washington and Idaho](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/summit.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, keeping in mind that the delivery of these physical items from this network usually takes between a week and two weeks.

### Refine Results 

<br>

You can filter to refine results many different ways, including `Full Text Online`, if you only want materials you read and download in their entirety, `Resource Type` to view peer reviewed or non-peer reviewed material, a `publication date slider` to filter chronologically and `Subject Filter` which uses the Library of Congress Subject Heading schema, which filters your search results by topic. You can learn more about [here](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)!

**If you are looking for Full Text Online results**, you may be sent to many of the different online periodicals that we subscribe to as a library. You will need to be logged in as a student and then look for **View Online**, where you will be sent to the online journal. 

{% include gallery-figure.html img="cals_intro_10.jpg" alt="Screen capture of item level digital interface of the library catalog." caption="Select View Online within the Library Catalog to be directed to one of our many databases to download materials" width="100%" %}

Though presentation may vary depending on the site, look for the **red and white PDF icon** that should send you to the download page.

## Search History

<br>

If you were previously able to find something you are currently having trouble recovering, as long as you are logged in, all of your searches are saved. 

{% include gallery-figure.html img="cals_17.png" alt="Screen capture of dropdown after selecting your profile name on the top right of the catalog interface.." caption="Dropdown after selecting your profile name on the top right of the catalog" width="75%" %}

To review, select your name in the top right corner of the catalog interface and select `saved searches` from the dropdown, where your results will be displayed chronologically from newest to oldest. The description of each search includes both the text as well as filters and attributes used.

{% include gallery-figure.html img="cals_18.png" alt="Screen capture of search history along with the filters and attributes you used, sorted chronologically from newest to oldest." caption="Search history along with the filters and attributes you used, sorted chronologically from newest to oldest." width="75%" %}
